Hello, I'm Gregory A. Dixon!

I am very interested in employment after reviewing your company website.  I have been seeking such an opportunity as this, and I believe my education and background would be a good match for your requirements. I bear with me strong technical and organizational skills and understand the fundamentals of a network and PC technician. I am a student at Augusta Technological College for an Associate degree in Cyber Security with a certifiate in Web Development. I was hoping that this profession will advance in my learning & work experience in my career. My resume is enclosed for your review and a more detailed review of my qualifications. I am looking forward to hearing from you and scheduling an interview internship, co-op, or volunteering opportunity for students, like myself, to get more experiences in their field.
